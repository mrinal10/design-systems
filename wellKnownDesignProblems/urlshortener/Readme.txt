A tinyURL is an URL service that allows users to enter a long URL, and then it returns a shorter, unique URL. 
A hiring manager might ask this to allow you the opportunity to show your solid foundation in design. 
You can focus on other basics not listed in the example response, like how you create a unique ID for each URL, 
how you handle redirects and how you delete expired URLs.

Example: "When I was working for a public instant messaging site, I was charged with creating a simple system 
where every message was limited to 140 characters. It also necessitated shortened URLs of about 30 characters. 
This tinyURL system is also useful when entering hyperlinks in e-mails or on a smartphone, where there is room for error. 
TinyURL is a perfect example of the hashtag table. This data structure associates keys with values and is a simple connections code. 
By using this basic 16-bit hash table, I was able to optimize usability and meet the needs of the system."
