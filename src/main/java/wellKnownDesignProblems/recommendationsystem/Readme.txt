Recommendation systems help users find what they want more efficiently. 
They help clients and customers by offering alternatives and allowing for choice. 
Hiring managers inquire about this to see if you are able to create systems that are user-friendly and focused.

Example: "One of my first and most loyal clients had a problem where their customers were struggling to find 
options on their website. Their search had to be exact in order to find the product. 
I suggested we implement a recommendation system to help with customer satisfaction and possibly sales.
 Using the most prominent approach of collaborative filtering, I designed the system to weave a sort of 
 nformation tapestry to give our client's customers suggestions based on user similarity. 
 The system became more user-friendly and produced a 10% increase in sales for my client."
