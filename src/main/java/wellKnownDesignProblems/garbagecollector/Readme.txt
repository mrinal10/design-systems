Garbage collection ensures a Java system is running appropriately and frees a programmer from having to do it manually.
 Hiring managers look to see if you know how to truly design the ins and outs of various systems. 
 A GC makes systems memory efficient.

Example: "One of my recent clients needed a way to have more memory, but there was an issue with always having to 
go in and deal with memory deallocation. The nature behind garbage collection is to make a system appear as if 
it has a seemingly endless amount of memory. What is really happening is that the system is re-purposing the memory. 
When a system is running slowly, a garbage collector goes in and collects what is no longer being used. 
I set up their system so that if an object is referenced or recursive in nature, it remains. Next, 
it goes through methodically and marks whatever has not been referenced and sweeps only that. 
Using the mark and sweep method with the void command helps to repurpose and open up memory no longer being used. 
With this in place, my client had a faster system with less maintenance required."
